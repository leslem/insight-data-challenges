- Problem: looks like there's a big dropoff in weekly active users starting in August
    - "active user" = a user who has made some kind of server call in the given week
- Possible explanations:
    - A change in the way that weekly active users is calculated
        - Calculate the same thing in the same way across the entire dataset
    - A change in the way that server calls are used for the product
        - Look at the individual types of "engagement" over time
    - A change in the interface making it harder or less pleasant for users
        - Look at individual types of engagement over time
        - Look at the experiments going on
    - A seasonal change that usually happens this time of year
        - Plot the weekly engagement stat over time for previous years
    - A change in emails sent meant the users didn't need to visit the website to get what they wanted done
        - Look at other actions going on
- Questions to answer:
    - What is the most likely source of the drop in engagement?
    - What, if anything, should Yammer do in response?
